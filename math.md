The gradients at a layer are usually computed with respect to the layer immediately downstream during the backpropagation process. However, in GradCAM, the gradients of **output classification logits** (the target class scores) with respect to a **specific feature map layer** are explicitly calculated. The code achieves this by:

1. **Using hooks** to capture the intermediate feature map and its gradients.
2. Backpropagating the gradients starting from the target class logits to calculate how sensitive the output is to changes in the feature map.

Let’s break this down step by step, both in terms of the **code logic** and the **mathematics**.

---

### **Step 1: Forward Pass – Extracting the Feature Map**

In the forward pass, the **local feature map** is captured using the forward hook:

```python
def forward_hook(module, input, output):
    # Store the local features
    if isinstance(module, PointNet):
        self.features = module.local_feature_map.detach()
```

Here:
- The `PointNet.local_feature_map` contains the intermediate features computed by the `PointNet` network.
- This feature map (\(A_k\)) represents the spatial features of the input data, where \(k\) indexes the feature channels.

---

### **Step 2: Backward Pass – Capturing Gradients of the Feature Map**

The backward hook captures the gradients of the logits with respect to the feature map:

```python
def backward_hook(module, grad_input, grad_output):
    if len(grad_input) > 0 and grad_input[0] is not None:
        self.gradients = grad_input[0].detach()
```

Here:
- During backpropagation, the gradients of the **output logits** with respect to the feature map (\(\frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_k}\)) are calculated and stored.
- This shows how much the target class score (\(y^c\)) changes when each spatial location in the feature map is perturbed.

---

### **Step 3: Weight Calculation**

The weights for each feature map channel are computed as the **global average of the gradients** over the spatial dimensions:

```python
alpha = torch.mean(gradients, dim=(2))  # Shape: (B, C)
```

Mathematically:
\[
\alpha_k = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \sum_j \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{k,ij}}
\]
Here:
- \(N\) is the number of spatial locations in the feature map (\(i, j\)).
- \(\alpha_k\) is the weight representing how important the \(k\)-th feature map channel is to the target class \(c\).

---

### **Step 4: Weighted Combination of Feature Maps**

The feature map channels are combined using the computed weights:

```python
weighted_features = alpha * features  # Shape: (B, C, N)
cam = torch.sum(weighted_features, dim=1)  # Shape: (B, N)
```

Mathematically:
\[
\text{CAM}_{ij} = \text{ReLU}\left(\sum_k \alpha_k A_{k,ij}\right)
\]

Here:
- \(\text{CAM}_{ij}\) is the **Class Activation Map** for the target class \(c\) at the spatial location \((i, j)\).
- The ReLU ensures only positive contributions to the target class are considered.

---

### **Explanation of Dependency Between Output Logits and Feature Map**

The code explicitly calculates the dependency between the **output logits** and the **feature map** by:
1. Capturing the gradients of the logits (\(y^c\)) with respect to the feature map (\(A_k\)), which show how each spatial feature contributes to the class score.
2. Using these gradients to compute weights (\(\alpha_k\)) that quantify the importance of each channel of the feature map.
3. Combining the weighted feature maps to produce the CAM, which highlights the regions of the input that contribute most to the target class.

---

### **Mathematical Summary**

1. **Forward pass**:
   - Compute logits: \(y^c = f(x)\), where \(f(x)\) is the model's output for input \(x\).
   - Extract feature map: \(A_k = \text{FeatureMap}(x)\).

2. **Backward pass**:
   - Compute gradients: \(\frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_k}\), showing sensitivity of the class score to feature map perturbations.

3. **Weight calculation**:
   - \(\alpha_k = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{k,ij}}\), a global average of the gradients.

4. **Weighted combination**:
   - \(\text{CAM}_{ij} = \text{ReLU}\left(\sum_k \alpha_k A_{k,ij}\right)\), the final attention map.

---

### **How the Code Works in Practice**

- **Hooks**: The forward hook extracts the feature map, and the backward hook captures gradients with respect to the logits.
- **Target class**: The code uses the target class index (either predicted or specified) to compute the CAM for that class.
- **Weights and CAM**: By computing the importance of each feature map channel and combining them, the CAM visualizes which input regions (points in the point cloud) are most relevant for the target class.

This approach explicitly connects the **output logits** and the **feature map**, enabling the model to highlight class-specific features in the input.


Let’s clarify the variables and equations step by step, properly defining each term with respect to batches (\(B\)), features (\(C\)), and points (\(N\)).

---

### **Variable Definitions**

1. **Input Dimensions**:
   - \(B\): Batch size (number of samples processed together).
   - \(C\): Number of features per point.
   - \(N\): Number of points in the input (e.g., points in a point cloud).

2. **Feature Map Dimensions**:
   - Feature map: \(A_k\) refers to the activations of the \(k\)-th feature across all \(N\) points.
   - Shape: \((B, C, N)\), where:
     - \(B\): Number of batches.
     - \(C\): Number of feature channels.
     - \(N\): Number of points.

3. **Gradients**:
   - Gradients have the same shape as the feature map: \((B, C, N)\).
   - Each value represents how much the **target class score** (\(y^c\)) changes when the corresponding point's feature is perturbed.

4. **Weights (\(\alpha_k\))**:
   - For each feature channel \(k\), we calculate the **global average of the gradients** across all \(N\) points for a batch.
   - \(\alpha_k\) has shape \((B, C)\), where each value represents the importance of a specific feature channel for the target class.

5. **Class Activation Map (CAM)**:
   - CAM is computed by weighting the feature map with \(\alpha_k\).
   - Shape: \((B, N)\), where each value represents the relevance of a specific point for the target class.

---

### **Equation Rewritten for Clarity**

#### 1. Gradients Averaging to Compute Weights:
\[
\alpha_k^b = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{p=1}^{N} \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{k,p}^b}
\]
Where:
- \(b\): Index of the batch (ranges from 1 to \(B\)).
- \(k\): Index of the feature channel (ranges from 1 to \(C\)).
- \(p\): Index of the point (ranges from 1 to \(N\)).
- \(\alpha_k^b\): Importance weight for the \(k\)-th feature channel in the \(b\)-th batch.

#### 2. Weighted Feature Combination:
\[
\text{CAM}_p^b = \text{ReLU}\left(\sum_{k=1}^C \alpha_k^b A_{k,p}^b\right)
\]
Where:
- \(\text{CAM}_p^b\): Activation score for the \(p\)-th point in the \(b\)-th batch.
- \(A_{k,p}^b\): Activation of the \(k\)-th feature channel for the \(p\)-th point in the \(b\)-th batch.
- ReLU ensures only positive contributions are considered.

---

### **Interpreting Variables Using an Example**

#### Case: \(B=2\), \(C=3\), \(N=5\)

- **Input**: Two samples (\(B=2\)).
- **Feature Map**: Each sample has 3 features (\(C=3\)) for each of 5 points (\(N=5\)).
  - Shape: \((2, 3, 5)\).

#### Feature Map Example:
For a single batch (\(b=1\)):
\[
A^1 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{1,1} & A_{1,2} & A_{1,3} & A_{1,4} & A_{1,5} \\
A_{2,1} & A_{2,2} & A_{2,3} & A_{2,4} & A_{2,5} \\
A_{3,1} & A_{3,2} & A_{3,3} & A_{3,4} & A_{3,5}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Where:
- Row \(k\) corresponds to the \(k\)-th feature channel.
- Column \(p\) corresponds to the \(p\)-th point.

#### Gradient Example:
\[
\frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A^1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{1,1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{1,5}} \\
\frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{2,1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{2,5}} \\
\frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{3,1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{3,5}}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

#### Computing \(\alpha_k\):
For \(k=1\) (first feature channel) in batch \(b=1\):
\[
\alpha_1^1 = \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{1,1}} + \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{1,2}} + \cdots + \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{1,5}} \right)
\]

#### Weighted Combination:
For point \(p=1\) in batch \(b=1\):
\[
\text{CAM}_1^1 = \text{ReLU}\left( \alpha_1^1 A_{1,1} + \alpha_2^1 A_{2,1} + \alpha_3^1 A_{3,1} \right)
\]

---

### **What is a "Feature Map"?**

A **feature map** refers to the activations of a particular feature channel (\(k\)) across all points (\(N\)):
- Example: For \(k=2\), the **feature map** is:
  \[
  [A_{2,1}, A_{2,2}, A_{2,3}, A_{2,4}, A_{2,5}]
  \]
- In the context of GradCAM, you compute one importance weight (\(\alpha_k\)) per feature map (i.e., per channel).

Thus, **k-th feature map** is one of the \(C\) feature channels, which corresponds to activations across all \(N\) points for a batch.

---

### **Summary**

1. \(B=2\): 2 batches of data.
2. \(C=3\): 3 feature channels (or "feature maps") for each batch.
3. \(N=5\): 5 points per batch.

For each batch:
- Compute gradients \(\frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{k,p}}\) for all feature channels and points.
- Average these gradients over points to get \(\alpha_k^b\) for each feature channel.
- Combine the feature maps using \(\alpha_k^b\) to compute the CAM for all points.

This highlights how each point contributes to the target class prediction.
